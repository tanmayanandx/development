A basics project to keep a score between two players in the game of ping pong.
One Player wins if he reaches to a certain point(that can be changed) before the other player. 
The player who won, he's score will be shown in green and the player who lost, he's score will be shown in red.
And one a Player wins, we'll have to reset the scores to continue it.

Used BULMA and practised DOM Concepts like events, buttons, listners.

In the end also tried to Refactor the JS code
(this score keeper is for two players)
